This line represents equality. “We are all equal regardless of race, gender, sexuality, age, religion & body type. “ and I couldn’t agree more! We can have DIFFERENT VIEWS without making someone feel less than ourselves. WE ARE ALL EQUAL IN GODS EYES 🙌🏼. Thank you to @lindacampbellgoebel and the Pureology team for the incredible hairstyle for this line! And thank you to @ltsphotography804 for these amazing shots! .

1,"SHE is mine and I’m f***ing proud! #SHEisMine
.
I don’t mean to upset you with what I just saw on the news, but this needs to be talked about. A four day old baby girl was found buried alive. She was found by a couple who were burying a child they had lost and heard her cries while digging a grave. She was buried alive because she was born a girl...
.
Tens of thousands of female babies are aborted every year simply because male babies are preferred by culture. This goes beyond unequal wages and the gender inequality we face in our own country, this is a matter of unequal and unworthy of LIFE 😭 What in the actual ****?
.
I believe that we are all equals, but in the case where any gender were to reign superior, should it not be female? Just saying 🙊 Without woman, there is no man. Women give birth to men, we gift them their LIFE. Without us, they wouldn’t exist. We birth men. We grow them, WE nurture them and raise them. That’s some pretty powerful stuff. How dare my daughter be viewed as “less-than” by anyone or any culture. #WeAreEqual
.
So here I am today, putting this out here because I feel compelled to try and make a difference. I’m mad, and heart broken. We need to change the world. So let’s do it, maybe we can save some babies. Let’s start a movement ♥️
.
This is my beautiful, amazing daughter whom I value EQUALLY to my son.
SHE is mine ♥️ and I am so damn proud to call her mine #EndGenderInequality
.
Will you post a photo of you and your baby girl or just a picture of her today with the same caption as mine? “SHE is mine and I’m f***ing proud! #SHEisMine #EndGenderInequality ” and join us in our fight for change! 💪🏼 Tag us so we can share and spread our message loud and proud, that these GIRLS are OURS and we are effing PROUD! 😭♥️ @theknottedcrown |#SHEisMine♥️ Even if you don’t want to tag us, please share something! Our babies deserve a voice. These baby girls deserve to be heard.",weareequal,"|How did we get there???

7,"In 2004, former Plan International Germany Director Marianne Raven was in Nepal discussing the challenges faced by a rural community.
She saw a girl called Sharmila who didn’t have enough clothes on to keep her warm.
When Marianne asked her mother why she wasn’t being cared for, the mother replied, “Because she is a girl,” and a campaign was born.
This marked the start of a growing focus from Plan International on the needs and rights of girls that resulted in Because I am a Girl transforming girls’ lives in over 70 countries.

I personally came across @planindia
In 2014 April that was the same month I got my first salary and wanted to do something more then just spending it on me.

24,"Menstruation/Periods.
(How women in countries like Bangladesh & India suffer during menstruation.)
-
Bangladeshi women suffer from menstrual problems such as dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, light and heavy bleeding during menstruation, and irregular period and are constantly worried if their menstrual flow is not a “normal” amount. They believe that a good menstrual flow is needed to stay healthy. If the flow decreases, they think that they have “bad blood” trapped within their bodies, and if it stops altogether, they are concerned that they may have become infertile. Inability to conceive is viewed negatively in Bangladeshi society and women are subjected to psychological distress by society if they are perceived as infertile. Also, there are many social, cultural and religious taboos surrounding menstruation such as staying away from foods such as fish, eggs, meat, sour fruits, etc during menstruation. Moreover, they are often advised to stay indoors as menstrual blood may attract evil spirits,as well as stay away from their own children and families.Gynecological problems such as those related to menstruation are a major concern among Bangladeshi women, but social stigma and shame stand as a barrier against seeking proper healthcare.Yes why not we stop hating women or keep thinking that they are impure while they are on periods.As @healtheworld19 have said earlier “world would be so much better if we get to understand each other’s emotions”.Women go through a lot, they just don’t show their emotions.Why not we all stand up for women who's having troubles with their menstruation. Women are heroes,they carried us for 9 months in their womb,brought us in this beautiful world.Then why are we not taking care of them??? Spread positivity,happiness joy around the world and diminish hate.Respect Women & their bodies.💪🏼

44,"Today I want to have a one on one talk with you guys. I've been thinking for a while to have raw cconversations. To interact better with you guys. We all have a story that no one knows about. A past we Can't forget. A future we can't predict. Why do we always have to be STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Why are our minds so stuffed up?. To the point we don't know what we're doing. And just with the flow, cuz that's better?. Why don't we find time for what we love the most?. Hang out with people that bring the REAL US out!?. We care too much about others, we care too much about what society thinks of us, we can't let out past go?. and we cant even stop thinking about what our future holds. ALL THESE THOUGHTS ARE WHAT WE ARE STUCK IN!. It's sad how we can't put ourselves first anymore.  If one tries to. They will either get bullied, pulled back, or be judged!. EVERYONE HERE IS HERE FOR A REASON. We are all unique. And we, ourselves need to understand this first in order to know our worth. IF YOU WANT PEACE IN THE WORLD, CREATE IT!.. Why have we stopped supporting each other?. I've so many questions.  And yet all I can do is think myself to sleep.. all these WHAT IFS, and WHYS are stuck with me. 
I want us to not only want better for us, but better for the world, better for the animals, plants, people, ourselves, our thoughts. We need to stay United.  We need to SHOW MORE LOVE. BECAUSE WE ARE ALL EQUAL. I wish I could say much more. And if you would like for me to talk on issues of the world.  I would love to. Just lemme know down below ❤

45,"Flashback to last weekends Hastings 10km, being escorted to the line by the event director on the lead bike. He came back for me after escorting the lead man to the finish. I was very happy to receive the same treatment that the winning man received. It’s a shame the journalist from the local paper decides only the winning man needed mentioning in the race report - you should probably mention the Women’s winner too right? Women just want to be treated equally. Equal pay, equal distances in sports, equal opportunities, equal respect, equal treatment #weareequal

⠀
Empathy, understanding and love are beautiful emotions us humans are able to give to others when hearing their stories. I think it’s important for us to take into consideration everyone’s back story through our everyday lives and work.⠀
⠀
When we get to truly know a person... their hopes, their fears, their insecurities, their hurts, their wishes, their regrets, their goals, their failures and their successes, we find it difficult not to love them once we learn what they’ve been through.⠀
⠀
We’ve all been through stuff and have vulnerabilities. There is always a reason why somebody is the way they are... lets not forget that ❤⠀⠀

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I am realizing that people like REALL so much more than posed and perfect. We can spend so much time making our feeds look just right or have the photo edited just perfect but I sincerely believe that the more authentic & real we are the more relatable we are. And the more relatable we are the better people feel. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We are all human. We all poop and pee and wake up with morning breath. Seriously. Think about it. Social media can cause us to feel so separated from others, as if we are so very different than the people we are following but we are all the same. We are all equal. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So today I celebrate those who show up real. This takes true self confidence and to me this is beautiful...

63,"“Community” can come in many different forms. This past weekend, I attended a Toyota Motorhome Club rally in Indiana. Going into the event, I really just expected to enjoy conversations around our quirky little RVs, but the depth of character shared amongst attendees was incredibly refreshing. I’m left reflecting on how we always have a choice: to isolate ourselves out of self-preservation or fear, or to seek out community with a willingness to be vulnerable, open to what it will return. .
.
.
Attendees ranged in age, home-base location, political views, vocation, religious beliefs, lifestyle... I could go on and on if I wanted to focus on our differences, but I don’t. Our differences disappeared when we all met on common ground, sharing knowledge, helping each other to fix this or that on our RVs, communing around meals, and telling spirited stories or singing songs around the bonfire. Over the course of the weekend, I learned as much about these wonderful people- and myself- as I did about my motorhome. We began our three days together as strangers and drove away knowing that we had that many more friends in the world. .
.
.
This isn’t a typical volunteer-centric post, but my experience from the weekend made me realize that one of the most beautiful aspects of volunteering is the equalizing effect it has on those involved in the nonprofit community. When a person approaches a strong community with the desire to learn and contribute, those positive commonalities shadow over individuals’ differences. We can all use a little bit more of that these days!",weareequal,|#vanlife #vanlifemovement #vanlifejournal #rvlife #rvliving #toyotarv #toyotamotorhome #toyota #community #travelcommunity #communitylove #weareequal #equalizer #overcome #rallylife #indiana #sharingiscaring #openup #communitygroup #carcommunity #findyourpeople #tribe #toyotatribe #newfriends #commonground #shareyourears #shareyourtable #winnebagolife #winnebago #bethechangeshow|I love this.,53

Denn, wie wir alle, haben auch wir viel durch gemacht, sowohl als Paar als auch jeder einzelne für sich selbst. 
Nur weil man ein paar hundert Kilometer weit weg fährt und die Umgebung traumhaft aussieht, sind diese Themen, Wunden und Herausforderungen nicht einfach auf lautlos gestellt oder gar verschwunden. 
Also möchten wir nicht verschweigen, dass auch wir, zwischen all den schönen Momenten hier, unsere verzweifelten, traurigen, überforderten und wütenden Momente hatten.

123,"Vor Nicole habe ich nie die innere Ruhe gefunden um zu lesen. Gelesene Worte blieben nicht lange haften. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Nicole liebt Bücher und wenn sie Worte gelesen hat, dann passiert so viel bei ihr. Es ist als würde sie die Texte in sich einsaugen, umarmen, genau betrachten und für sich das Beste entnehmen. 
Mich beeindruckt immer wieder wie sie ihr Bewusstsein durch Bücher weiterentwickelt.📖 Mittlerweile schaffe ich es auch über eine lange Zeit ein Buch alleine zu lesen. .
Doch am meisten nehme ich selber mit wenn ich Nicole vorlese. Durch das laut gelesene Wort und das gemeinsame besprechen nehme nun auch ich viel mit. Wenn wir nun gemeinsam unterwegs sind, ist auch meist ein Buch an unserer Seite. 👭❤️ .

❗️aktuelles Buch : ISMAEL von Daniel Quinn❗️ Definitiv ein Buch, dass dich in deinem Bewusstsein gegenüber unserer Kultur und Zivilisation verändert.

The same way that women have been mistreated, under-appreciated and used, men have also suffer from the different symptom of a sick society. Instead of taking parts I believe we should educate and understand each other more, support in equal measurements and leave behind the stereotypes that only put us apart.

Trust me I know your plight you see I am the son of a Black Woman who had her priorities in order who maintained self respect because she knew who she is. I am not trying to blame just explain. The woman was created to be the INFLUENCER, the INSPIRATION the MOTIVATOR. Read the story of Adam and Eve. Imagine Eve standing there( this was before they covered themselves) fine as wine skin smooth as silk asking Adam to take a bite. You follow me.

153,"I wanted to do a post about the impeachment proceedings (which is finally happening!!!!) but I couldn’t figure out a good saying or something so I think I might write a poem and post it tomorrow instead.
Anyway, this is a picture I’ve had for a while but never got around to posting, I got the words from @wanpoetry and it’s really enlightening y’all should watch it. 
White Privilege is something a lot of people want to pretend doesn’t exist. And when they acknowledge it theyre like “oh this is ALL the racism”....but it isn’t. Like not even close. 
What do y’all think is gonna happen with the impeachment investigation? 
Personally I think they will impeach him but he might get acquitted so who knows( if that statement confused you feel free to DM me I’ll be more than happy to explain)

188,"""Growing up I had no idea I’d be as resilient as I am today. Shame, embarrassment and insecurities embraced me the way I wished my peers would. I never seen anyone like myself growing up. So, I decided to become an example without a guide. My skin encompasses the strength of all the pain ridicule provides. It’s something so beautiful, so unique and so authentic. I couldn’t ever imagine a life where I wasn’t myself, I’m glad I don’t have to. I’m grateful to be me."" — @lyricallydiverse captured by @sophiekietzmann

Shoutouts to @zeek805 @xai.vfx @kaylee_official_ @_good._.vibezzz @eq.asp. 
I’ll leaving the general gaming community for a duration of 6 months. I may be back for Christmas but no promises! I’ll always have a place for this in my heart! Watch this whole thing. Leading @equal_org had a lot of doubt in my heart as to what a real friend is and I realized it’s not about doing everything for you; it’s about the ones there for your lowest points and those that’ll be there for your highest. A lot of the ex members taught me those of which that lack confidence, maturity, dedication, honesty, love, perseverance,  will always leave you. They will never support you but they will always hold on regret and intuition will always allow them to know they are wrong. It may not seem like a lot to lie to some stranger from the internet but in actuality I’m some stranger that actually gives a fuck about everyone in all. Storm Szn is in full affect. See you soon💕

217,"To the pieces of @&#*^@#% little high school boys that are talking shit about my daughter behind her back....
Let's be clear that she has earned her spot on the Royals! She has 4 years, 5 seasons, 2 championship games and a championship ring to prove her place. The blue Jersey that she wore proudly today at school was not her boyfriend's, ITS HERS! She actually doesn't have time to date you pathetic immature knobs... because she's so busy earning her spot. 
She has been the only girl on her teams for years, which as any other woman knows that means she's busy breaking a glass ceiling. When you are sleeping in, she's up training, when you go home after school football team practice, she goes to coach another football team. *** Understand this, Sophia has to worked at least 3 times harder than you do, while you question her being on a team because she is female, and dealing with inappropriate comments... and sadly more, so if you feel the need to question if she should be on the team because she is a Girl feel free to message me so we can have a real discussion about if you've earned your place on the team.
🤦‍♀️
To @sophia__rose66 don't you ever give up, and don't let their words touch you. If anything they are afraid to be shown up by you. I and many others are so proud of you. You are amazing and you are doing amazing things!

223,"It is so incredible to see so many people owning their power and becoming teachers, healers and role models for others In these times of change. However, one has to be very careful not to allow the negative ego to intrude by putting themselves above everyone else just because they have a degree or certification. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
We are all teachers AND students. We are here to experience, learn, grow & evolve. Our encounters with others are instrumental in this process and we must always be open to seeing our mirror reflection in those we encounter, allowing others to always teach us something new about ourselves. Every single person on this planet has a special wisdom & uniqueness to offer the world. Be careful not to be led by the egos lure. We are all in this together. We are all equal...here to learn and here to teach in our human experience. 🙏

230,"Unglaublich, dass es mich fast Überwindung kostet, mich selbst als Feministin zu bezeichnen. Feminismus ist in meinem Kopf noch immer wahnsinnig negativ besetzt. Mir kommt da gleich Alice Schwarzer in den Sinn, deren mediales Image in den 90er und 00er Jahren meinem Teenager-Ich den Begriff des Feminismus offenbar gründlich verhagelt hat. Ungeschminkte „Öko-Tanten“, die keinen BH tragen und Männer als absolutes Feindbild haben. Oder Aktivistinnen, die barbusig und lauthals Parolen schreiend von Polizisten abgeführt werden.

Dabei genieße ich alle Vorteile, die die Welt dem Feminismus zu verdanken hat! Allein die Tatsache, dass ich diesen Text posten kann, ohne meinen Mann um Erlaubnis bitten zu müssen, ist für mich ganz und gar selbstverständlich. Für so viele andere Frauen ist das aber noch immer nicht denkbar! Und auch ich selbst stoße fast täglich auf Ungerechtigkeiten gegenüber Frauen, die mich fuchsteufelswild machen!

So kann es nicht weitergehen. Jedenfalls nicht für mich. Nicht mit mir. Noch habe ich keinen Plan wohin mich diese Gedanken führen werden. Mal sehen.

Bist du ein/e Feminist/in?",weareequal,"|#feminist #ichdarfdas #girlpower💪 #feministmovement #feminist #feminista #icandothattoo #feminists #feministas #girlpower #weareequal|Bin ich. Die Negativbetonung des Wortes ist leider vorallem durch strukturellen Sexismus bedingt. Fast durch die Bank wurden Frauen, die für ihre Rechte einstanden als „hysterische Alte“ dargestellt und Männer, die sie darin unterstützten als „verkappte Schwuchteln“. Es hat sich gebessert, aber noch bei weitem nicht im ausreichenden Maß, nicht einmal hierzulande.",7

I responded to him saying that, ""no we want equal rights for every gender"" . He didn't reply! Feminism has such a bad reputation from the media, it needs to change!

241,"#TRUTH ❤️ Some words of Mooji that often come to mind when we observe the need of many to continuously emphasize all the ‘spiritual’ stuff they are doing, while downgrading those who don’t. 
Translation “If you think that you are more spiritual because you do yoga; are a vegetarian; buy only organic products and crystals; do reiki and meditation; wear hippie clothes; visit temples and reads about spiritual enlightenment, but judge those who don’t do these things, then you are entrapped in the trap of the ego.” ~ Mooji says it all ♥️",weareequal,|#yoga #ego #egomind #weareequal #trapoftheego #trueyoga #consciousness #mooji #arrogance #spirituality #bereal #truth #truewords #wordstoliveby #love #compassion|👏,24

257,"Today is a Great Day! It is also a great time to sit with yourself and make a promise to never neglect your internal self. When you begin to listen to the confusion or pain within you, that’s when you take control of your LIFE.

It’s easy to go through Life accepting the uncomfortable emotions we tend to hold inside. Then defending the process of self sacrificing for others and need of being accepted. I’m fine, it’s ok ... when it’s Not!
The truth is that we neglect the one person that has coped with so much all your life. Has been loyal and supportive at every stage, never abandoned you and yet we easily ignore their distress .  We don’t listen to our internal child... who deals with the BS of others and the decisions based on their needs and wants.
When you value and respect that internal you, the one that is childishly honest and curious for all that LIFE has to offer - you will be stronger and happier. 
Then you are the Best for every person because you will show them what it looks like to be Responsible for the future.

309,"#equality ♥Today, spontaneously, I joined the Equality March walking down the streets of Katowice for a moment. I was attracted to smiles, happy songs, positive people, and quite sad thoughts. Colorful flags fluttered above their heads, elderly people were on the march, there were children on their parents shoulders, there were dogs, there were mothers with teenage daughters and sons,  grandparents who hold hands, fathers who supporting their children in discovering who there are, heterosexual couples who showing support and the police who took care of the marchers' safety. In my country, one of the equality parades taking place in the summer ended in a massacre - firecrackers were thrown at people, beaten their people, humiliated, threatened with death, spit on them, eggs and glass thrown at them and much more physical harm was done to them. Nobody received any help, on the Internet were congratulated on having beaten an innocent person, and people from the equality parade were prosecuted and harmed. ""Man and woman - a normal family"" that's such slogans guided are by people with homophobic inclinations, who enjoy beating or humiliating another person because she is  herself or him is himself, and that's all. PLEASE STOP! I joined the march today because a thought appeared in my head - yes, I'm afraid of muscular people shouting their vulgar slogans of extreme homophobic nationalists, but if something is to happen to me only by the fact that I love who I love, it's okay cause it is a sign I don't have a problem. I'm not interested in strangers with their a private life and if I was to be hurt for smiling and singing among cheerful people of all ages, I'm ready for sacrifice. I'm proud of continuous work on myself and specialist doctors made me aware that my orientation isn't a disease or a problem, so I believe them and not aggressive men and women with a strange worldview❗

326,"Authenticy. I come from a place where honesty, authenticity and realness was welcomed.  I got a message from a close friend this past week, who just knows me SO well. My own anxieties have come forward as my head is piling up with the do's of the year ahead, the appointments, the schedules ... and before a lot of it begins, I'm exhausted. Speech therapy, feeding specialist, occupational therapy, EEG's, genetic testing. My mind is filling up and I go to release some energy and then this happens.  I'm at the park the other day, where I could tell a social conflict might happen as a younger child approached Wes while he is in his own world <3 I kindly explained that Wes' doesn't talk much to the Dad (and then sat like the helicopter parent I feel I NEED to be) to which he shared his brother didn't either and it was just laziness and once his mom decided she wouldn't take it any longer he snapped out of it ... I HELD MY TONGUE... I get things like this a lot from people.  Another favourite is ""well, he will talk one day, it's no big deal"" etc.  I feel the need to defend him by sharing ALL of his struggles, as if not being able to communicate isn't hard enough. I am always observing when I'm around friends, I see how much they direct, teach, guide with just their words. Take that part of your relationship away.  THIS TOPIC HAS BEEN A TRIGGER FOR ME FOR SO LONG & usually ends in tears.  So when you're out and about please be kind.  We are all walking a different path and there is nothing more discouraging than to have someone minimize your story. 
Westley has A LOT of amazing qualities, his difficulties don't define him, and they don't define me as a parent.  Westley can spell, he knows all his colours, numbers, can count back and forth and has amazing balancing skills.  Comparison is the thief of joy ✌️

329,"Obwohl ich im Einzelhandel arbeite, habe ich in den vergangenen Jahren fast ausschließlich online eingekauft.

Kurz bei Amazon, Zalando und co. getippt, gescrollt, geklickt und „zack“ ist wenige Zeit später das Paket bei dir zu Hause.
Dann habe ich mir nur die eine Frage gestellt: „Behalten oder zurückschicken?“ 🤷🏽‍♀️ Erst in den letzten Monaten ist mir bewusst geworden, was das bedeutet.

Nun stelle ich mir lieber folgende Fragen:

Wo wird produziert?
Zu welchen Bedingungen?
Müssen Menschen wegen meinem Konsum leiden? 
Welchen Einfluss hat mein Konsum auf die Umwelt?

Und...
„Brauche ich DAS?“ 🤔

Wenn ich mir was gutes tun will, ist es dann der Kauf von materiellen Dingen?

Was macht mich wirklich glücklich?

383,"È passato un anno da quando ad agosto 2018 è morta Dalila, lei sapeva benissimo a cosa sarebbe andata incontro e ha deciso di farla finita appena ha potuto: dopo solo quatto ore dal suo ingresso in carcere.

Il procedimento per il cambio dei documenti è ancora lunghissimo e difficoltoso per le persone transessuali e Dalila, aveva ancora il vecchio documento e per legge è stata inserita in un carcere maschile.

Anche voi pensate sia assurdo e ingiusto ? .

At iCBD we are proud Vegans and understand that all animals and humans are equal. 150 million animals are being killed every day for our selfish race! You wouldn’t eat your dog or cat and sheep, cows, pigs and chickens are no different! You wouldn’t drink your wife’s milk so why an animals! They all have feelings and they feel emotional & physical pain like us so why would we continue to torture & murder them when we can get all the nutrients a human could ever need from plants. It’s all a no Brainer to us and people that choose to remain brain washed are only fools to themselves. Not only are you hurting, killing and eating living things but your also killing yourself. Just look at how many people have diseases or are struggling with some mental or physical health disorder. Meat, dairy and eggs are the root cause ! But if you used some common sense you would see why, your eating dead rotting corpses!! Or milk that’s meant for a baby cow! Or it wasn’t actually it was drugs making the cow produce the milk! (Torture) Wake up people it’s time to think outside of the box ☝️

Sarà un caso proprio che una FAMIGLIA ARCOBALENO abbia dato vita a un gesto di uguaglianza e solidarietà vs il diverso? Io non credo!
Io preferisco condividerlo oggi che stanno iniziando a parlarne meno perché è una carezza al cuore che non va dimenticata ♥️

Grande merito a Desirè Nica <3

L Italia quella bella, oggi ve la racconto io da Trapani
.

Sono le 13.00, e arriva sulla spiaggia uno dei tanti ambulanti che cercano di vendere qualcosa.
Solo che stavolta è donna
.
Solo che stavolta è mamma
.

Ha una cesta enorme che tiene in bilico sulla testa, con dentro tutto ciò che vorrebbe vendere, e dietro, legata sulla fascia, la sua bambina.
Avrà 2 anni e mezzo, 3 al massimo. Sta sotto al sole in groppa alla sua mamma mi chiedo da chissà quante ore
.

Subito mi sento in difficoltà
.
Guardo mia figlia e penso che sono 3 ore che mi affanno per farle scegliere cosa mangiare, per coprirle la testa dal sole, per stare attenta che non beva acqua troppo fredda.

Dico a Gabri che vado a comprare qualcosa da quella mamma e che vado a portare un po' di frutta fresca alla bimba e darle qualcosa da mangiare
.

Ma non c'è stato bisogno di fare niente
.

Perché oggi l'Italia bella è stata quella delle mie vicine di ombrellone che tutte insieme hanno detto a quella mamma come loro, di andare a lavorare tranquilla, perché alla sua bambina ci avrebbero pensato loro
.

Ed è proprio così che è andata
.
La mamma ha continuato il suo giro per le spiagge, e la piccola ha mangiato insieme a tutti i nostri figli sotto l ombra del ristorante dello stabilimento, ha giocato sulla riva, ha fatto i gavettoni insieme agli altri bambini della spiaggia
.

E io oggi sono felice, perché è stato davvero bello vedere tutto questo ❤️

Now don’t get me wrong, we all do things we regret, however I take serious issue with the fact that she boasted about her “Racial Tolerance” and how she hoped to spread it throughout the state... Tolerance? So our governor just tolerates other races? I’m not so sure her feelings have changed much from the 60s with that explanation and word choice. Guys please expect better from our leaders.

The only thing that I ask you is to open your mind and see how beautiful they are with no judgments, we have no differences , so with compassion and small changes we can do a lot , I think this is the best way 🙌🐶🐷🐯🦁🐹🦆🐥🐝🐴🕷🦟🐜🐝🐓🐄🐈🦃

Your worth is not defined by what you’re doing, but your being.
.

I strongly believe that if everyone lived from this conviction, we would;
.

Be more compassionate towards
ourselves and each other
.

Set healthy boundaries
.

Had better health
.

Been more creative
.

Helped each other
.

Been more positive
.

Felt more joy and inner peace
.

Created more good energy
.

Created more peace
.

Cared for our planet, the animals, each other
.

And the list goes on.
.

Every day we have a choice to think, feel and act from a place of hostility or a place of love.
.

It all starts within each one of us.
.

I choose love!❤️

409,"Wie kann es sein, dass drei Leute versuchen, einen Dieb zu stellen und von geschätzt 20 Rumstehenden nur ein einziger Mann hilft, damit die Diebesbanden vielleicht mal lernen, dass sie nicht immer so davonkommen?! Und wie kann es sein, dass solche Diebe einfach wieder laufen gelassen werden, weil sie Flüchtlinge sind? Versteht mich nicht falsch, wenn jemand fliehen muss und Hilfe braucht, soll er sie haben! Überhaupt, wenn jemand Hilfe braucht. Aber das kann kein Grund sein, dass diese Leute nicht bestraft werden. Wer Mist baut, muss dafür Verantwortung übernehmen - jeder, ganz gleich, welches Alter/ Geschlecht oder welcher Herkunft oder was auch immer. ~ 
How could it happen, that three people struggle to catch a thief and there are about 20 people just enjoying the show? And just one single man comes to help? So that those gangs might learn there will be consequences! And how can it be right that the thief will be free just some time later - because he is a refugee?! Do not get me wrong. Everyone deserves to be helped if they need help either the had to flee or not. But this can’t be a reason for not being punished. If you mess up you have to show responsibility NO matter how old you are or what gender or nation or what ever!  #wasstimmthiernicht #dankedeutschland #weareequal #responsibility #deutschland #politik #fassungslos #dankebüroetage #sicheristanders #echtjetzt #frustrated",weareequal,"|Gute Besserung 😘|Oh ha 😮 Gute Besserung 💖|Gute Besserung, meine Liebe 😘🍀 und ja, ich stimme dir völlig zu.

438,"Happy Women’s Equality Day! We love this message from @britandco founded by @brit Morin. Young women need to see take-charge women in all areas of society. BE A LEADER.  Our future depends on it. (Image by Brit + Co)⁠
⁠
Why do we celebrate Women’s Equality Day on August 26th? On August 26, 1920, Amendment 19 was finalized:⁠
⁠ “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.”⁠
⁠
This first voting rights hurdle was huge. But don’t forget that this was only extended to white women. Women of color did not get the right to vote until 1965, 45 years later. While we have made gains over the years, we have a LONG long way to go. ⁠
⁠
Hope you join us today in celebrating #womensequalityday by doing something to advance women. Whether it be advocating for a women’s group, mentoring a young woman, or simply being vocal where you see inequality, every little bit helps. While it may be cliche, “Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean.”⁠
⁠
Need suggestions? We are loving the message over at @equalitycantwait started by @melindafrenchgates  See some ways to take action at https://equalitycantwait.evoke.org/action⁠
⁠
This is not a sponsored post, just real admiration for those passionately advocating for the advancement of women. ⁠",weareequal,|#EqualFuture #weareequal #equalitycantwait #girlsdoitbetter #styleyourmind #feminism #feminist #thefutureisfemale #equality #investinwomen #equalitynow #feministAF #vote #womenvoters #19thamendment #1920 #womenempoweringwomen #melindagates #womensupportingwomen #badasswomen #ladies #girlscan #incharge #wegotthis💪|#strongsmartbold,33
439,"today is #nationalwomensequalityday 
on this day, in 1920, women were finally granted the right to vote. .
Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Staton, Martha Wright, Mary Ann McClintock and Jane Hunt are to thank for setting this fight in motion. they began the battle for the right to have a voice in 1848, and 171 years later we are not only able to vote, but run for office as well. .
women’s equality has come so far, and there is still a fight to fight. i’m still not able to walk alone at night without fearing for my safety, i carry a small knife on my key ring because i feel i have to and my voice still gets lost amongst the voice of men. .
let’s continue to fight for true equality. not women above men, or men above women, but equals. fair rights for both and equal opportunities. .

You wouldn’t eat your dog or cat and sheep, cows, pigs and chickens are no different! You wouldn’t drink your wife’s milk so why an animals! They all have feelings and they feel emotional & physical pain like us so why would we continue to torture & murder them when we can get all the nutrients a human could ever need from plants. It’s all a no Brainer to us and people that choose to remain brain washed are only fools to themselves. Not only are you hurting, killing and eating living things but your also killing yourself. Just look at how many people have diseases or are struggling with some mental or physical health disorder. Meat, dairy and eggs are the root cause ! But if you used some common sense you would see why, your eating dead rotting corpses!! Or milk that’s meant for a baby cow! Or it wasn’t actually it was drugs making the cow produce the milk!

447,"Growing up, I assumed life would be easier if I pretended I was the same as everyone else around me. I didn’t want to focus on the things that made me different — on my appearance or the surgeries I had to have. Instead, I compartmentalized my experiences. I tried to convince myself I was the same as everyone else, because maybe if I forced myself to believe it, everyone else would too. But I’ve spent the last few years coming to terms with my differences. And for some, it may be annoying that I talk about my appearance and my facial difference so much. But for me, it’s the most liberating thing in the world. To be able to say “this is me. Take it or leave it,” and go to sleep each night okay with who I am feels like a miracle. I spent so many years drowning in the weight of who I was (more about that in my book). Living unapologetically is freeing. And I’m only at this point now from writing and sharing my story — from connecting with others who have had similar experiences to mine. All of this is to say that there is so much beauty in living authentically, in being different. Whoever you are and whatever your story is, be you. Shine your light. Speak your truth. Let your freak flag fly. Because even if you don’t believe it now, there’s a whole community of people out there waiting to love you.",weareequal,"|#latenightthoughts #selflove #acceptance #disfigurement #bodypositivity #bodypositive #crouzonsyndrome #visibledifference #craniowarrior #facialdifference #equality #bodyimagemovement #makethechange #iweigh #lovedisfigure #faceequality #behindthescars #scarstrong #weareequal #bodypositive #ihaveembraced #bethechange|You're amazing and an inspiration! 😍😍😍|You're strong and also beautiful😍♥️|OMG!

To me she is normal, she is my normal❤️ but to others, she is not.  I feel like I fail her everyday.  When stranger in Target says ""what's wrong with her?"" I smile and say ""nothing"" ever so politely.  Sorry Target stranger, I don't have time to go down her list of diagnosis and surgeries, especially not in front of her like you seem to thinks she doesn't understand  that we are talking about her right in front of her... hello?!!!

It's not okay.",weareequal,"|oop hi|Ok this comment has nothing to do w the post but more about your bio, you spelled ""friendly"" wrong. I didnt want to dm you because i feel this isnt a big problem just wanted to let you know ❤️|You have earned 1+ follower! ^^ 🌱💞🐌💞🌱|I’ve heard that editors don’t have permission to take commissions as it’s actually not theirs and kinda making money off a creator. But Gacha players are allowed to edit not commission! Correct me if I’m wrong! :)|Haha sorry girl but Im not that type of artist... :/|Yeaaaaaaas I'm 100% agree with you!|I really recently just started getting into the gacha community buuut my friends dislike it (I'm not saying hate because some of the stuff, they like about it) yeah they're all artists but it's not because of the ""tracing"" and honestly all that crap is annoying how people think using bases is ""tracing"" artists uses bases! And also the part about artists hating the gacha community for getting more attention.. that's all complete bs first of all I kinda see why, the gacha community isn't just art but you can create stories and glmv's etc. etc. There are many more subjects to choose someone may not like the art but like your stories and vice versa... I’m not just talking about the artists either (I mean I’m an artist myself and i haven’t abandoned the art community just to join the gacha community but thats another topic-) some gacha users really DIDNT try when making stories and stuff... but when making art even if its a simple style you can see the hard work and time it took.. instulting a gacha editor its like insulting an artist.. i know editing isn’t the same thing though its still art as you proved in the post everyone has they’re own opinion but if you’re being rude no ones gonna wanna listen to you (sorry for the long text- and also im agreeing with you 😅)|Honestly I find this thing so stupid I have a friend who does edits and they are amazing they take so long to do. So people stop saying it isn’t art because it is.  artists are suppose to RESPECT EACHOTHER AND TO NOT GIVE HATE TO OTHER ARTISTS SO GET OVER IT|Why is this feud even a thing? Why can’t everyone just do their own thing and get along?|Mmmm cool. ❤️|I agree with you.....except for the tracing and “GACHA CREATORS DONT PUT EFFORT” Part. People trace over the “base” for their edits in order for it to be a “gacha edit” so yes,it is a form of tracing. For the “gacha creators don’t put effort” part we mean the mini stories,”singing battles”, and the GMV and how they are just screenshots made in KineMaster. An animator can do an animation meme that has beautiful art and editing and animation and get like half of the attention and exposure then a person that took screenshots and put copyrighted music in. Although that might sound like animatics the difference between animatics and gacha mini movies etc. is that with animatics you are drawing contrast to gacha where you use the same bases and such. BUT (yes there is a but to this) if they are as good as the ones you showed then that wouldn’t be considered overrated, in fact those posts deserve the attention they get.",81

450,"UPDATE!! So maybe 2 weeks or so ago I made a post where I found a rogue flower blooming through the cracks of packed ground and stone despite the challenge 🌺. I also found it crushed the next day... (8 posts ago, it’s a pic of a white flower, def check out the story behind it). I have recently noticed that the flower is trying to make a comeback!!! It’s beginning to grow some green leaves and sprout once more 🌱  I’m excited 🤗  I have tried to establish a barrier with rocks as a physical fence around it. Might add to it to help people notice it. I want to take special care of it this time. For some reason that flower really spoke to me and I neglected to pay attention the first time, but it looks like I get another chance.
We don’t all get second chances when we neglect something to the point it is then taken from us. Be mindful of what is truly important. It’s all about the little miracles ✨🌷

457,"they say they seem to be perfect enough to continue to judge. we should try to be together in the situation they are in, then we can look at all the angles. when they are in a negative environment, we should bring them out in a positive direction.
talking and judging is easier than exploring and understanding the situation. each position has different angles and not everything will work out the way we expect it to.
they are already stressed enough in their efforts to improve their steps and strengthen their role. not only do they have to face great opposition but they also face an uncomfortable situation.
if you cannot accept failure or lack of trust, simply dismiss the complaint. do not let it go to your heart, and at the same time judge it to be a bad judgment and to create a gap between you.
stop right away, we are the same .. just different places and ways. but judging one another is not our nature.

Yes it does. Women usually get shorter sentences in jail for the same crime as a man. Women are usually not expected to be as tough as a man, Girls usually have the advantage in the classroom because most teachers are women. I mean that girls usually are treated as more mature rather than a boy who has the same knowledge and maturity level. Women are more likely to get help in the case of being suicidal. Men will be more likely to actually do it. A woman can say a man raped her whether true or not and he will most likely be thrown in jail, Women are actually listened to more in the office space believe it or not. (Speaking from experience here). Woman in some countries have protection from certain laws that men don’t. Etc.|❤️ This discussion and I think simply yes it does. It can sometimes simply be getting an apartment over a male or non binary identifies.|I think a lot of female “privilege” still comes out of patriarchal ideals and the same gender roles that are toxic to women. The man paying for their food at the restaurant- women traditionally don’t have control of their money and ‘need providing for’. Women who commit murders etc being less likely to get caught- all women exist to be mother figures who give care and are kind and selfless and gentle so “they’d never do anything like this”. Getting certain things because men are attracted to them like drinks or club entry- this ‘privilege’ has just opened the door to future harassment. 
I see someone in the comments has mentioned they get better treatment than non binary identities and I think that’s a great point. But one of the key reasons for that is that cis women are interpreted as serving their expected purpose, which traditionally in society was pleasing men.|Omg so many of sexbuyers say ‚I go to prostitutes because if a pay a woman a dinner or a drink I don’t know if I get sex afterwards‘ and it’s like all about sex. They only pay this for the women to get sex. Of course not all men but it’s a quote many sexbuyers say",46

Meet Nathalia, the motivational speaker and self love advocate behind @lovingmydots ! Nathalia was born with #nevus — a non-genetic birthmark that covered 40% of her face in addition to the moles, or satellites, all over her body. From the time she was 9 months old until the age of 13, Nathalia had many surgeries to remove her facial Nevus. And in 2018, Nathalia started sharing her story on social media as a body positive advocate. She now gives motivational speeches to help others build self-esteem too! I’m so grateful to have connected with Nathalia and hope to attend #SXSW with her and Marialuisa next year. The three of us are so passionate about #disfigurement and #visibledifference . I know I’ve been talking about SXSW quite a bit lately, but there is only ONE MORE DAY left to vote for panels.

Ariel Henley is a writer with Crouzon syndrome. After dozens of surgeries that altered the appearance of her face, she grew up in a world that insisted on defining her by a face she didn’t even recognize. As an identical twin, Ariel grew up not only experiencing the impact of this treatment firsthand but witnessing it as well.
.
She’s written articles about disfigurement and facial difference for outlets like The New York Times and Teen Vogue. She is also the author of A FACE FOR PICASSO, a forthcoming memoir about her experience with disfigurement, which will be published in winter 2021. By telling her story, she hopes to help eliminate stigma, educate others about the importance of facial equality, and promote mainstream inclusion for individuals with physical differences.

486,"PLEASE READ AND TAKE NOTICE.

Last night Paul Pogba witnessed Racial Abuse throughout the whole match. This is absolutely disgraceful to see that this kind of hatred is still around in the world of football, not just inthe world of football but in life in general. And how many times that these low lifes have to hear no matter what the colour, religion, or nationality, we are all the same. I hope these sick people realise how much damage they are causing to families. We should give them as  what i call a taste of their own medicine. They have to realise and come to conclusion that the world has changed, they need to learn that equality is a thing not a word. Some people say that ""oh we have to move on be strong"", but what they're basically doing is that they are letting these trouble makers who think this is entertainment to take over us , and make us all enemies. We stand with Pogba.

490,"By @kwanamikaela144 THE NEXT PHASE OF CHRIST CONSCIOUSNESS EMBODIMENT - FALSITY - SPIRITUAL COMMUNITY
It took hours to absorb and observe this Occurence in planetary and Collective level because it is Big; understanding of it to each of us will come in perfect timing, because, it's started and will amplify.
Source Diamond Ray/Light that came IN during 17th August, brought New spectrum of coded particles that in constant calm streams deeply penetrated into our Solar Diamond Crystalline LightBodies for opening of the next 'phase' for Christ Consciousness Embodiment. Many of us in 'entire energetic environment of planet' could feel 'too big calmness', while actually is undergoing collapsing of Falsity.

FALSITY AND SPIRITUAL COMMUNITY
This next 'phase', if you will, will bring forth:
Spiritual Community - leaders, teachers, gurus, healers, coaches, speakers, and more, - hidden 'spots', spiritual business: Are all that says being from 'Light Love', truly with pure intention for Collective elevation?
Embodiment of Christ Consciousness means that EQUALITY and COLLABORATION are qualities for each's individual ascension (elevation of Collective).
Our Divine Services are blessed gifts to share as vast as possible for ALL Highest Good, but in every moment you and I, we are Equal. We are Equal Divine Facets. I honour you for we are ONE.
I am feeling that this is Big Turning Point and from there any 'Falsity in spiritual community' will fall away in very seen way.
It will give true opportunity for those who were rooted in 3D Light Program - perception, to step into their own Divine Power more and more. 
To gain CONNECTION with ourselves is to become aware that everything you searched Outside of you so long waited for you WITHIN, deep Within. 
We are LOVE ❤

505,"Real men ARE feminists. Why shouldn't they want equality? The stigma that feminism only helps women is utter crap. Men need equality too. We all want equality. The idea of equality and feminism is so simple. 'Genders being treated equally'. Yet this message isn't being translated. People think that Feminist isn't a good word. But it is. People think men can't be feminists. But they can. I have a good friend who agrees that women should be equal to men but doesn't want to be a feminist because feminists are extremists. When they aren't. These all annoy me so much but the core anger behind each refusal to feminism is stereotypes. So all you other feminist accounts are doing such an amazing job. Carry on!

Earlier we believed, that history owes an apology to us for letting you all mistreat us from the start. We were down there, under your feet ; Struggling yet United ✊Life has been a beautiful struggle. It still is. Why ? Let us tell you a fun fact ! 
You know what even harder than waiting for a bill to pass ? Changing This Societal Perception.

550,"Compassion becomes real when we recognize our shared humanity. It binds us together. We want to turn our suffering into hope for the future. A different approach we have turned to is sharing the stories of other humans and releasing the stigma attached homelessness and to their ""reputation"". The more we share and connect the more we can see the change happen in our lifetime. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Saw this in the loo at a restaurant the other week. They have this message instead of a mirror.

Thank you @labaraccabali - you made me stop and reflect.
.
If I was 100% happy and at peace with myself... Would I need to stop and check that my hair is okay?
.
No.
.
(Maybe this is why many great spiritual masters shave their heads? 😂... @radhanathswami @srila_prabhupad)
.
A nice reminder that I’m already enough.
.
A nice reminder that we are all, already enough.
.
A nice reminder to try and see the beauty in everyone I meet.
.
And, a nice reminder to try and treat everyone equally.
.
It’s easy to forget that behind this material illusion, we are all the same.
.
We are all lost, divine souls, trying to find our way.

Love

555,"Every night before bed Ruckus comes up to me for pets and snuggles. When we rescued Ruckus and Bella, we also saved Ruckus’s sister Stormi, who passed away from pneumonia. The night she passed away my heart hurt more then anything for Ruckus, cause he knew his sister was gone. I stayed up all night with him and my mom came to sit with him the next day. I’ll never forget him nuzzling her body, wanting her so badly to get up. I still get choked up thinking about it. But in return I got the most beautiful relationship with Ruckus and Bella and that I am so forever grateful. Animals are just like us, only different.

561,"Trying to get a picture of both of them is a game in a half lol. What funny boys these two are. They are such huge pieces of my heart and soul. Has anyone else had trouble this summer with the 100 year storms that keep hitting? I have lost more grass and seed this year due to flooding, amongst other things that we have resorted to feeding more hay then an average summer. It cost us about $175 a week for hay right now and winter it doubles! Due to last weeks storm, a portion of our driveway got washed away, and needs to be fixed this week before any more water damage can occur to our property and surrounding houses. This is an added expense we were not planning for, and if we could raise the money to cover this weeks hay bill, it would be a huge weight lifted ❤️ A hay bale is $6, and we need 30! Every $1 adds up and means the world to all of us here at the Happy Home! Fingers crossed tomorrow’s storm is nothing like it has been 🤞🤞🤞. Thank you for believing in our journey!

Somehow I did well. I adore the wisdom she shares. All the years remind me of the importance of friendship and bridges and of taking care of one another. I compete with no one! I am me and I only dislike the feeling when others don’t understand this and try to force me to shift or try to look down on me when we are equals...

563,"I do think there is an appropriate time and place to ask questions but demanding/asking random women and nb people to explain feminism to you is just shitty. You have access to ALL of the information. Use it. Read some articles. Read a book. Listen to a fucking podcast.

582,"🕋
Pic of my son & I leaning against the Kaaba. I am hovering over him to shield him from the crowds. His head is shaven bc we had previously completed our umrah pilgrimage.
🕋
The Kaaba is a cube-shaped building in Mecca around which Muslims circumambulate as part of pilgrimage. It is covered in a specially made black cloth, called the kiswa, decorated with Arabic / Islamic calligraphy. Getting to touch the Kaaba is a particular blessing, especially one corner of it holding the black stone.
🕋
Currently millions of Muslims are gathered in Mecca for the annual Hajj pilgrimage. During this time Muslims follow the footsteps of prophets & pious predecessors, such as Abraham and his wife Hagar, by performing certain rituals.
🕋
Tomorrow, 9th of #dhulhijjah, is the greatest day of the Hajj when they will stand on the plains of Arafah and beseech their Lord with countless prayers & tears.
🕋
Muslims all over the world will also pause on this day to reflect, pray, & worship, as it is one of the holiest days of the year, even for those not in Mecca. It is an important day to fast, as it absolves the sins of 2 years, the previous & the upcoming.
🕋
That is also the day that Prophet Muhammadﷺ gave his farewell sermon, detailing critical advice for his followers. Swipe to read all of it - 2 excerpts below:
🕋
To the men: “It is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under God‘s trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed & clothed in kindness. Do you treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners & committed helpers.”
🕋
To all: “𝙰𝚕𝚕 𝚖𝚊𝚗𝚔𝚒𝚗𝚍 𝚒𝚜 𝚏𝚛𝚘𝚖 𝙰𝚍𝚊𝚖 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝙴𝚟𝚎, 𝚊𝚗 𝙰𝚛𝚊𝚋 𝚑𝚊𝚜 𝚗𝚘 𝚜𝚞𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚒𝚘𝚛𝚒𝚝𝚢 𝚘𝚟𝚎𝚛 𝚊 𝚗𝚘𝚗-𝙰𝚛𝚊𝚋 𝚗𝚘𝚛 𝚊 𝚗𝚘𝚗-𝙰𝚛𝚊𝚋 𝚑𝚊𝚜 𝚊𝚗𝚢 𝚜𝚞𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚒𝚘𝚛𝚒𝚝𝚢 𝚘𝚟𝚎𝚛 𝚊𝚗 𝙰𝚛𝚊𝚋; 𝚊𝚕𝚜𝚘 𝚊 𝚠𝚑𝚒𝚝𝚎 𝚑𝚊𝚜 𝚗𝚘 𝚜𝚞𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚒𝚘𝚛𝚒𝚝𝚢 𝚘𝚟𝚎𝚛 𝚋𝚕𝚊𝚌𝚔 𝚗𝚘𝚛 𝚊 𝚋𝚕𝚊𝚌𝚔 𝚑𝚊𝚜 𝚊𝚗𝚢 𝚜𝚞𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚒𝚘𝚛𝚒𝚝𝚢 𝚘𝚟𝚎𝚛 𝚠𝚑𝚒𝚝𝚎 𝚎𝚡𝚌𝚎𝚙𝚝 𝚋𝚢 𝚙𝚒𝚎𝚝𝚢 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚐𝚘𝚘𝚍 𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗.”

589,"2 weeks ago, @noortjepalmers came to me with the idea to create a human rainbow for her new photoseries En Masse 🌈 The rainbow is not only a symbol for the LBGTQ-movement, but also for peace & equality. It’s colors are vibrant and beautiful, and each one is different than the next. With this project we wanted to send a beautiful message of inclusiveness, cohesion and equality. The result demonstrates how beautiful diversity can be and just as the rainbow, it teaches us to embrace our own differences and the differences of those around us.

598,"2 years ago I decided to remove as much negativity from my life as I could. 
So I could focus on my happiness and leading a positive life. I decided it was time to invest in me !! Step one .... STOP INVESTING IN PEOPLE THAT DONT INVEST IN YOU 👊

All types of relationships should be a two way street. 
When we invest in others we give them our time and when we learn that our time is valuable we stop giving it away.

Stop asking how someones day is going when they dont first ask you.
Stop making time for people, when they dont make time for you.
Stop being present with people, who are not present with you. 
Always remember your worth !! No one is first or second in a relationship - We are only equal 🙌

599,"**Please read for explanation of these videos**⁣
⁣
While traveling around Northern Thailand this past week, I had the opportunity to visit some elephant camps. I’ve been thinking a lot about how to present the information I learned and the photos/videos I took in a way that would not only point you toward more hands off ways of viewing elephants but also help to see elephant tourism/handling/care as a scale, more so than seeing it as black and white. So I’ve decided to split this story up into a couple of posts. For this post I just want to explain what “stereotypy” is in captive wildlife, because that’s a really important part of assessing psychological health and welfare. ⁣
⁣
The term stereotypy describes behaviors seen in captive wildlife that are abnormal (aka wouldn’t be seen in the wild). These behaviors often come about due to lack of stimulation (barren or inadequate environment), strict schedule of feeding or the restriction of food, inability to socialize, close contact with humans, and are used as a coping mechanism for stress. These are behaviors that an individual uses to reduce its stress; a good human example would be biting nails, fiddling with hair, pacing, tapping feet, etc.

As you can see in these videos, these two individuals show severe stereotypy. Swaying, trunk swinging, rocking, pacing, aggressive trunk flicking, these are all stereotypical behaviors that the individuals are using to cope with something that is causing stress. ⁣
⁣
Now, I know this looks bad. But just so everyone understands in full, many many many elephants show stereotypical behaviors in one way or another. Not just in camps where they are in small enclosures and being ridden, but also in sanctuaries (which is a big part of the research I’m doing). Management cannot necessarily stop these behaviors completely, but does have a major impact on frequency and severity. ⁣

605,"If you’ve experienced an abusive or traumatizing relationship, you know the feelings of shame, regret, self-blame, and judgment of others. I’m not proud of it, but I used to be a person who judged women who were in abusive situations. “Why don’t they just leave?” “I’d NEVER allow a person to treat me that way.” I made assumptions about the type of woman who found herself in relationships with violent, manipulative people (weak, unintelligent, no self-worth, lesser than). It’s shameful to admit but it’s true. Now I’m one of those women, and I’ve met MANY others on this leg of the journey. And I can tell you first hand that it is SO much more complicated than that. Every women I’ve connected with who has suffered and survived an abusive relationship is a beautiful-hearted, compassionate, kind, SMART, Loving, resourceful, and strong human being. People who are abused tend to be trusting and open, which make them often easy prey for abusive and manipulative personalities. We don’t EXPECT people to hurt us, we see the best in people, we believe in Love and the ability of a person to grow and improve themselves. People who are abused are some of the kindest, most Loving souls. I know this now. I’m grateful for the lesson. I’m grateful for the authentic connections I’ve made through all this. Someday I dream of meeting in person all the women who were ever victimized by the man who hurt me, looking into their eyes, and embracing them in a hug that I’ll hold as long as they want me to. I feel so much LOVE for these women, and for every person who’s been through something similar. There are a LOT of you out there. For everyone else, think twice before you judge someone in a situation that you know nothing about. Until you have walked another’s path, you are ignorant and cannot speak to their choices or their experience. And like the picture says, we’ve all done things in our lives for which other people can judge us. What’s that bible verse... pull the plank out of your own eye...? (Yeah I know it. Just reminding you to think about it.) A good practice is to check yourself every time you start to place judgment on someone else ❤️",weareequal,|#dontjudge #weareequal #stayinyourlane #compassion #abuse #trauma #relationships #mentalillness #love #kindness #judgment #forgiveness #lifecoach  #lifelessons #grateful #humbled|True!,26

But this post seems e suggest that every man is one of the above, and blatant sexism like this is the main reason there is opposition to feminism.

625,"Ich lebe nun seit mehr als einem Jahr vegan und überlegte lange ob ich etwas aus dem Trailer von #dominion posten sollte. In diesem einem Jahr fühlte ich mich oft ausgegrenzt und verurteilt. Wie kannst du nur Vegan Leben? Es gab und gibt nur eine Antwort: Ich will nicht dass ein Lebewesen für mein Leben leiden muss! 
Dominion war der ausschlaggebende Punkt. So drastisch. So konsequent und so ehrlich zeigt keine Dokumentation, wie sehr wir nicht nur unserer Welt schaden, sondern auch Tiere foltern, quälen und hinrichten. Nur um zum Abendbrot das Brot mit Salami zu belegen und zur neuen Netflix-Serie die Gummibären zu verschlingen. 
Ich stoße immer noch auf Unwissenheit und Intoleranz, weil viele denken, dass ich jedem zum Veganismus zwinge. Ich zwinge niemanden, aber ich bin ein Mensch. Und als Mensch habe ich eine Aufgabe. Die Wahrheit zu zeigen. Dominion zeigt die Wahrheit. Und deshalb hab ich mich entschlossen wenigstens einen Teil vom Trailer zu zeigen. Mittlerweile gibt es den Film auf Deutsch. Kostenlos! Auf YouTube! 
Vielleicht halten mich wieder einige für verrückt, aber das ist mir egal. Wenn nur eine Person sich diesen Film anschaut, bin ich stolz auf diesem Post. Entscheidet selbst:

The only limit to your freedom is that of which you set... Do not allow the labels society was built on determine your tomorrow - be who you want, be who you please...
We should all work together not against one another as the challenges that await are not one of a select few, but ones that concern every han living here, from the old to the young, for the boys and girls, for the rich and poor, everyone is concerned...

648,"“ My feminine side to me is how I prefer to show who I am as I know I am/I identify as a female and am proud of who I am! I have tried the tomboy and short hair style but it just wasn’t me, dressing feminine helps me feel more like who I really am. I know that because I don’t fit the typical stereotype of a girl who likes girls has made it difficult to find a girl. Many times I’ve tried talking to girls and have been rejected because I “don’t look gay enough” or they “don’t trust bi girls” which I don’t think is fair. I find the LGBTQ+ community deals with enough discrimination, and I don’t think we should be doing it to each other! I think we need to work on including our own community more before we can be mad at others for judging us as well.” •

I call a @uber and the uber driver was very fast. I enter in the car and 10mts after we start his working, we were stop by the police because he just open the window and press a button in the car panel. The @polizeiberlin argue he was one the phone doing a call. He wasn't! 
They stop the car almost 15minutes during my way back to airport and they were rude. Other uber cars pass through us, pressing the phone buttons and the polizei didn't act. 
I told them that the guy wasn't on the phone and we try to show them the uber record. And you know what? They told me to fuck off because they didn't care. Isn't their problem. 
Interesting point: Bassam, Uber driver, is from Palestine and having a big beard with shaved head, like me (I've less beard).
Sum up: berlin police send me to fuck off just because I ask them if we can move forward because I have a flight? Really? This how you approach people that don't talk German? Why you have biased people doing this job, jeopardizing who are working just for free? 
@Uber you should understand how your drivers in Berlin are losing money and customers because the Polizei stop the cars when the drivers accept the travel orders.

655,"This world would be so much better if ppl could only open their eyes into matters that really count. Last night i stressed my mind out about how miserable i feel when i see how ppl lost their paths, their dignity, their dreams. You should stop going by the trend and make your own path. This cruel misconceptions and internet viral stuff takes out all the humanity left inside of us. Ppl are so busy to run after popularity, money, followers. In the end of the day none of this will actually stay with you or make you feel  peaceful. Ppl forget so easily they used to be simple, they run after succes like its some kind of status that permits you to live in here. Wake up, you have been born with the right to live your life and you are already succesful without being some kind of millionaire or popular vlogger bla bla. Internet opened so many of way for ppl who doesnt even have any talent or life experience to make themselves “popular” just by making fun of trivial stuff and blind brains actually like it cuz so that’s the trend😪. If you want something nice in life start to treat yourself nice and take care nicely of the ppl around you who actually care about even when u are nothing . I learnt you cannot achieve true succes without working hard or fight truly for what you believe in. You don’t need to compete with others cuz your place is already yours anyway. The world makes us turn our back on each others when love and compasion should be the key in surviving better and get along..start appreciate more of what is fragile and unique and strong not what ppl make fun of or show the others through their phones. Beside that full account of cool pictures etc most of them are empty and have nothing to offer to anybody. Selfish people will never get it in the end..this is our ruin right now..everyone think is better than someone else but in the end we are all equal! #hateloverelationship #mikachu #thought #mylife #advice #world #wise #appreciatelife #iexist #worldwide #betterlife #itsuptoyou #change #model #lost #weareequal #thoughtsinwords #instaquote #modelinseoul",weareequal,|Divina...😮😍,77

659,"Mental health in itself is a taboo for many  and for especially for men accessing mental health help or even express their feels seem against cultural expectations. However, slowly we are trying to break the chain of stereotypes and stigma.

On July 28, 2019 we had a wonderful experience with our campaign on “Men's Mental Health Awareness:-#MardKoBhiDardHotaHai~ Boys Do Cry” for which there was great participation from all walks of life and appreciation to highlight the issue🌟♥️ We are thankful to @raahgiri_day to support us every time 😁😁😁 Here are some snippets of our AWARENESS WALK; the PLAY focusing on emotional blockages in various stages of life which ultimately effects the mental health faced by Men as well like pressure of being the only breadwinner with no say to their career, gender stereotypes, stopping from expressing, frustrations, aggression etc.; FLASH MOB to help motivate the audience to give chance to grow healthy; ACTIVITIES conducted post-play focusing on breaking the stereotype of expressing their feelings; and ending on a positive note through a POETRY written and recited by team member! 
A huge congratulations to the each and every member of team MANSA for the appreciation by the audience who lend an open mind and positive words to spread more awareness✨💐 #MANSAforMentalHealthAwareness

678,"Is it just me or does it seem like everywhere we look on social media we are told we are in need of self improvement and that we should surround ourselves with high value individuals who share our beliefs and goals (even though last I checked, we were all equal)? From what I can tell, this mostly results in a society where we are all reinforcing each other's point of view and patting each other on the back for being really amazing.

684,"Education is a fundamental human right.
No matter our origins, our color, our orientation, our financial situation, our social situation - having access to school, to a place of knowledge is essential for the development of a stronger youth, of a stronger society, ready to combat the problems we face together as one...
Having access to these locations is not a privilege and not should this ever become the case, it is a right for all humans to go to school and learn what they want... It is a priceless right... Much like food and water, housing and electricity... How can we seek a unified society if we cannot allow those who walk tomorrow the opportunity to analyze yesterday to build tomorrow... Education should be accessable to all, free for all - no matter the education course, and be of the upmost quality to ensure that we give all the keys to our future... It doesn't matter if your a child from the top 1% or one who had to flee a warzone, you are entitled to the same quality of education... This is basic human rights, and should not be a question or a concern in the first place... It is time to change our views and start giving the keys to our young to help us find solutions to our problems that plague our everyday life... #education #raiseyourpencil #human #humanright #standup4humanrights #inclusion #everydayactivism #weareequal #together #help #knowledge #sdg #sdg4 #globalgoals",weareequal,|Totally agree.

693,"We are ALL equal. No race, gender, sexuality, religion, belief or background is greater then the others. Everyone is equal. Everyone deserves a good and happy life. We are ALL human beings with families, friends, beliefs, memories, and lives of our own. Why is it so hard to understand this? We all breathe oxygen, require food and water to survive, want companionship and love. We are emotion filled human beings who respond to our surroundings in a good or bad way. We are all equal. It pains me to see such ignorance from people who have so much hate in their hearts. I just wish that more people were able to love one another instead of having such envy and hate.

That judging based on what everyone else is doing doesn’t make it better. In fact it hinders my progress. To just let myself fly! Try it. Try doing a pose, a climb, dancing or anything you feel like doing and pretend like no one is watching. Just do it for you! Way different!!
🌟🌟
It’s a practice....
🌟🌟
I’m not saying that we can’t seek inspiration from others. It can be quite inspiring to see what others are up to...however,  it is important to honor ourselves and our own path.  Listen to ourselves..deep inside. To allow ourselves to find our own way. To be happy where we are..we need to learn to love ourselves for who we are and love everyone else for their awesome unique rad ness too. Then we can work together to make some really cool things happen! Seriously!..

719,"I try not to tell people I meet for the first time I’m vegan, because I don’t want them to immediately judge and stereotype me, because it has happened a lot before. Also, I don’t think animals are people. Animals have feelings like us, but no they can’t really do all the same things, but that’s alright and they still deserve respect. Killing isn’t a personal choice, because the animal never volunteered to die to be eaten. Free will is something you have to willing choose though. Still if you aren’t vegan, I don’t think I’m better than you.

724,"🍇These aren't ordinary grapes. These grapes are very special. You see, these grapes took 11 years to come to fruition, and they are a sign of the amazing things about to happen. 🍇 11 years ago, my dad and I decided to start a winery. He went to school and I bought land. And shortly after, I became deathly ill, went through an nasty divorce with a broken man, and sold the land. 🍇 5 years ago, my (new) hubby and I decided to revive my dream on his family land. We put up a fence, started buying plants, and had our friends teach us more. Then the distance between my house and my MIL's house became too short, and once again, we moved and gave up on my winery dream. 🍇 Three years ago on a trip to a winery, we impulsively purchased this plant. As Shabby Chick grew, I knew my winery was years away. And still is. 🍇 These grapes are a sign. It's harvest time. I have worked hard and long. I have carefully prepared myself; growing and stretching myself; never giving up. Not death, not illness, not hate, not doubt, and not sabotage has been able to keep me down for long. I believe we reap what we sow. I believe we choose our destiny. I believe my dreams are about to come true. I love the woman I have become and I deserve what is heading my way. 🍇 What are your dreams? What are you doing to make them come true?

734,"Women have to work much harder to make it in this world. It really pisses me off that women don’t get the same opportunities as men do, or money for that matter. Because lets face it, money gives men the power to run the show. It gives men the power to define our values and to define what’s sexy and what’s feminine and that’s bullshit.

744,"#throwback to last Monday, when I conquer my 25th #highpoint!! Contrary to popular belief, #bearmountain is the highest summit in #Connecticut, but not the actual highpoint! To get to the highpoint, one must hike the #MountFrissell trail in #Massachusetts, hike to the summit, and then descend on the south slope to get to the marker on the state line. At this marker is CT’s highest point at 2,379ft. (~725m)! You can also take the trail an additional half mile to get to the tri-state marker between NY, MA, & CT! A total of 3 miles (~5km) RT & 1,000ft. elevation gain should not take longer than 3 hours to complete!! Although the trail is lined with mountain laurel - CT’s state flower - the overgrowth on the trail makes it difficult to navigate at times. 25 states down (NC GA MO SC AL MS VA TN AZ FL LA IL IN OH KY AR KS OK NM TX NH VT NY MA CT), 25 to go!!!!
.
As I try to do with most of my trips, I reflect on how grateful I am to have these opportunities! Unfortunately, this took me to the site of the deadliest grade-school shooting in US history. 27 people lost their lives at #sandyhook back in 2012. Funding for a permanent memorial is  in progress, but I hate to see us become so desensitized that we forget we have the power to prevent more of these atrocities from happening month after month, year after year! RIP little ones.

752,"Reposted from @erinmyluv -  This is something I haven't talked about yet but it's time i share our story because we aren't alone. We are often judged on first impressions, categorized as a ""special needs"" family & often we are seen differently. We fight along side of many others to prove that people with all different abilities belong with & are equal to their peers. But something just as important to us is the undocumented human rights of people & families just like us. We are just one family out of millions going through this.
This is our reality & so many others who don't have a voice. This past January Pablo left for work just as any other typical day. What we didnt know was ICE (immigration) was watching our apartment in search for someone else. Because of that they profiled Pablo, he was followed to work, stopped, and taken into custody. Yes he is undocumented & yes we had already been in the process since Elena was born of applying for his permanent resident card, but its definitely not a easy fast process like many think. We are thankful to our family & friends who called me early that morning to tell me what was happening, because of that our attorney was able to act fast and intervene in the process of deportation. Though Pablo was released that night in an agreement with ICE that he participates in a program. ISAP is a way of immigration to ""keep track "" of undocumented people while they are fighting there case and still being deported. The rawness is that he must wear a ankle bracelet and is tracked every step he takes. Let me say, Pablo has been here in the US for 19 years, longer than the time he spent in Mexico. This is his home, this is where he, like most people, want to stay and work and be with his family & watch his kids grow up. We are one of the lucky ones, he is here and we got to go back to our life as best we could for now. We get to enjoy having our family together as it should be. But there are many others who aren't as lucky.

How to go on with our life missing the only one who understood our true family routine. Stand up for human rights. Stand up for what you believe in. Stand up for love. Children don't belong in cages. Stop separating families. Close the camps. No more raids.|I love you guys!! And many people judge without knowing what it’s like to being in our shoes living in fear everyday. We will all get through this together❤️|I don’t think I could love you all anymore than I do! We will continue to fight this. @erinmyluv|Thinking of you ❤️|Thinking of you ❤️🦋|❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️|Wow.. ❤️❤️❤️|Erin, we worked together before and I always had the upmost respect for you, I hope everything works out for you and Pablo because you guys deserve it. I want you to know that I was in Pablo's shoes for a long time. I, like many others, was brought from my country as a child. Trying to escape a civil war and a violent abusive father, looking for a better future. It's been almost 30 years now and thanks to my wife I've never had to hide again for a long time. It's a horrible feeling to be in his shoes, but God is good and he's gonna take care of him. No good member of this society, undocumented or not should go through this. I wish you guys the best and if you need any advice about the process, please feel free to reach out. 🙏🙏|❤️|❤️❤️❤️|❤️❤️❤️|Standing with you and your family. It is outrageous you have to go through this. ❤️❤️❤️❤️|@erinmyluv Erin I have faced this but from a different angle. A few years ago when all this started to heat up I was working in a middle school . We had students in our class that were in such anxiety that they could not focus on their studies and in one case one student experienced numbing in her extremities due to stress.  We did our best to calm their fears and committed to them that if agents came on campus that we would close and lock the doors to our classroom. We would not let them be taken. Every child deserves the right to feel safe on a school campus in the United States. Just know that there are a lot of  people in their own way standing with families. We are humans first. Much love to your sweet family ♥️|Thanks 4 sharing ur story and I know what u are saying they shouldn’t separate family and help them #familiesbelongtogether #united #stopthehate|😭😭❤️❤️ breaks my heart.|Makes me so mad and sad!

education and human rights education.

It's hard to understand for someone like me who has had the privilege to grow up in Finland well known for its good education system that in many other countries education is not a guarantee. Especially not for girls... I guess that I just have to accept and understand that I cannot fully understand. Not now, not after. We can try to understand as good as we can but I think it's important to admit that no matter the facts, we can never argue that we fully understand another human's growth and life. Whether you have grown up in the same country, same city or even same family. Don't you think?

Hoje, continuo a ‘sentir muito’ por sentir muito, mas ainda mais sinto pelos que sentem pouco ou nada. 
A minha vida pode ser uma montanha russa mas ao menos não é cinzenta, os sentimentos continuam a ser a minha bússola interior. Quando estou triste, carrego a depressão às costas mas quando a moeda muda de face sou envolta por um fogo de artifício sorridente que faz tudo valer a pena. 
A astrologia diz que sou Balança e de facto, sou uma balança que pende tanto para um lado como para outro, mas sem nunca perder a integridade e enfrentando com o peito aberto o dia de amanhã com a certeza que o vou sentir na totalidade do meu eu físico e mental. 
Muito amor,

779,"🤬 My whole life, I've heard, ""Girls can't do that!"" ""Women don't act like that!"" And ""What will people think?"" 🎖️At the ripe old age of 14, I traveled 1500 miles from Montana to Alabama to attend military school. By choice. I wanted more. I wanted a better education. Military school in the 1990's wasn't always kind to the 10% female population. We didn't have female uniforms, female sports, and at times, being a girl was something I needed to ""overcome."" 🤠 My son recently turned 14, and the generational lapse struck me. I now reflect differently on this time period. I'm reminded that I am so very brave. Seriously? What kind of kid WANTS to go to military school 1500 miles from home? Me. Me who is brave. Me who set out 25 years ago to build the life I wanted. Me, who leaps at opportunities. Me. 😇 I'm so grateful for the leaps I've taken in my life, even the ones where I smacked the ground on impact. I have failed many times, but I am satisfied knowing I've leapt more than I've failed. I'm grateful I never cared what people thought.

We began to research, bought a farm, and started homesteading. We raised our own food, learned to make all sorts of stuff that I thought grew in stores, and set about getting rid of unnecessary and unhealthy chemicals. 🏡 I started remodeling our old, dirty farm house- The cleaners' stench would run me out of the house! So I started buying ""green"" cleaners, only to be unsatisfied. I hate Cleaning, I don't want to do more work. So I started making my own. I had 2 criteria for every invention: 1. It MUST work better than my toxic cleaners; and 2. It must be 100% natural. 🏆 4 years later, my products have been clinically tested to out preform leading brands; are still 100% natural; we have been featured on the Home Shopping Network, won the Small Business Association's Entrepreneurial Success Award, the InnovatHer Women in Business Challenge, and the SCORE Small Business Championship. 🤗 Hang out with me and I will encourage you to do amazing things with your life too!

807,"Took this photo July 15th 2016 and I’m not sure how I feel that this statement is something we are still trying to bring awareness to or understand as to why it’s so easily tossed out the window.
.
Colors aside: We are all humans.
.
✖️We are all equal in the fact that we are all different. We are all the same in the fact that we will never be the same. We are united by the reality that all colours and all cultures are distinct & individual. We are harmonious in the reality that we are all held to this earth by the same gravity. We don't share blood, but we share the air that keeps us alive. I will not blind myself and say that my black brother is not different from me. I will not blind myself and say that my brown sister is not different from me. But my black brother is he as much as I am me. But my brown sister is she as much as I am me.✖️- [@cjoybellc]
.
On this day, July 4th, when we talk so much about freedom and independence, let’s also remember the many that don’t have that same liberty, in the US and around the world, simply by the color of their skin. When in fact, we are all human and should be treated as such.

837,"Till today with my experience I have never found a person happy with his/her body who got teased by somebody earlier. Sadly, it's the most in our country that every person is treated with bias for their natural body type. Every fat girl that is teased for her being fat, how she feels trust me nobody has a clue. That “perfect” body that models have to have in order to be a model proves our obsession with zero figure. Don't believe me? This is how people refer fat people- an elephant, potato, couch and so many other names. If you call somebody with such names and think this is funny then do you have a count of how many times you have put somebody down, played with somebody's self-esteem, made somebody cry.You might not feel the biggie in being called with such terms BECAUSE it doesn't affect you as you're not fat. In TV serials no guy wants to date a fat girl and fat people are always shown binge eating, lazy, eating junk, foodie and you will rarely find any romantic scene of a fat person romancing,because of it the insecurities that people have with their bodies is disheartening. People still trying to find a diet that can change their size.

I'm fed up of seeing people taking supplements to get fat and saying we're trying to be healthier. Lol, who are you making fool, me or yourself? If you wanted to be more healthy you would exercise, eat healthy, lead a healthy lifestyle but no you're taking supplements on which slogans are very healthy such as “weight gain”. Do you know what's the mentality of a fat girl, that insecurity and fear in her mind while passing a group of judgemental people, there's a constant fear in her mind that at least they don't make fun of me today. I feel so sorry for myself to be a part of such generation who think making fun of people's body is cool. Unless and until it doesn't happen with us it seems cool to us and the minute it happens we feel disrespected. Being fat or skinny is not a problem but when people call us with such terms we feel offended, even if we're comfortable with our bodies because they say that to offend you, to put you down and when someone says something to put you down you feel disrespected. There can be two different people calling you fat but with different intentions, somebody saying it WITHOUT the intention of putting you down and somebody saying it to put you down. Just because somebody is skinny doesn't mean they are malnourished and just the way if somebody is fat doesn't mean they don't let others eat their part. It's high time that we raise the standard of our jokes and stop saying rubbish about other's body. It's their body so their concern, they should be the ones worried about it every time and not us, I don't know what pleasure we get by putting out the obvious things about them with hard hitting words.|Do you know fat individuals are married less often than normal weight individuals. Also, assumption of somebody's personality and traits based on their bodies is wrong(i.e he/she is fat that means they are lazy, they exercise less often). Teachers in school without any hesitation make fun of fat students. In one survey, preschool children reported that average size children are given more preference in plays, lead roles, dance performances.
Statements like “she's too fat to be an actress” why size should be our consideration in an actor/actress? and why not the acting abilities. Fat girls are often told not to wear short dresses, bikini, tops because their curves will make them look odd and everyone's eyes would be on them for that reason.
Statements like “she's too lucky, she got married with such handsome groom even after her being fat” shows our stereotypical thinking for fat bodies. Also, we should report ads like “pehle mein mota tha tab meri zindagi dukhi chal rahi thi mera koi dost nahi tha phir maine xyz khaya jisse mai mota hogaya aur ab mere dost hai” pisses the hell out of me.|Also, the subject of stand up comedians our always fat/dark. They say all the offensive and harsh things especially to this category of people. Just because you're falling out of content doesn't mean you will say anything in the name of freedom of speech. All the speakers either they're poets or even stand up comedians, their words have an IMPACT. There are a lot of things about which Indian Janta can have a laugh, so try something new, targeting a category of body is extremely bias of y'all who do this. Also, In schools teachers perceive that fat individuals work more poorly compared to average weight students in the first look and give lesser attention to fat children. A national survey found that individuals who are overweight reported a three times higher livelihood to be denied medical care than the average weight people. They are hired less often for jobs, they have greater termination rate than average weight individuals. Their psychological health also suffers:
they have lower self esteem, lower self concept, higher rates of depression and anxiety disorder, suicidal thoughts and what not. Weight based teasing associated with higher rates of binge eating and unhealthy weight control such as fasting, self induced vomiting,diet pills, skipped meals and smoking.|I don't endorse being unhealthy but I definitely can't support people making fun of a category of body for having a laugh because I don't find it to be funny, I don't understand people encouraging their closed ones to change themselves to be loved by the world. Fat is also aesthetically beautiful, sexually attractive, you should draw fat people, you should see fat people, you should date fat people, you should desire fat people because fat people are beautiful and worthy and NORMAL and they too deserve to be termed as attractive and desirable. They don't need to change themselves, we need to change our mindset. People who think fat people are the most unsuccessful, hopeless, weak willed, lazy people are themselves that way, because they are so lazy that they're not allowing their thinking to grow and a person without growth is weak willed and unsuccessful and therefore hopeless.
What can we do to stop body shaming?
Confront the people who perpetuate body shaming, and tell them that others have feelings too and they also feel bad. As I always say it's just the role of thinking, if you want to see beauty in sombbody you will find beauty ( like her smile is so beautiful) and if you want to find somebody ugly you will notice ( oh, god her face is filled with pimples, marks and what not.) IT'S JUST THE ROLE OF PERSPECTIVE.|💞|Yess 👏👏 🔥",49

Foto ini mendadak viral. Perjumpaan sederhana yang tak biasa. Sebab tak seperti foto antar umat Katolik dan pemimpinnya, foto ini jadi terlihat istimewa. Foto seorang muslimah dari negeri dengan mayoritas berpenduduk muslim dan pemimpin milyaran umat Katolik dunia. 
Penegasan Dewi soal identitasnya adalah wujud penegasan akan harmoni kehidupan antar umat beragama meski secara iman berbeda. Dewi yang merupakan aktivis Gusdurian dari Jawa Tengah membawa wajah rahmat semesta alam pada Bapa Suci dan begitu sebaliknya ia mendapatkan senyum kasih untuk uluran tangan persaudaraannya.

Betapa indah ..🙏

852,"SENTIMIENTOS ENCONTRADOS... ...es lo que hay cuando por un lado vemos todo el apoyo que se está dando a la búsqueda de igualdad, al apoyo a que nadie debe de ser juzgado o maltratado por ser o sentirse diferente a los demás o a lo considerado normal. 
Cada vez son más las personas y empresas que hacen su apoyo públicamente pero esto también trae consigo una ola de comentarios tan ignorantes o sin fundamento que solo dan cólera, rabia, impotencia, y muchas cosas más.

Comentarios como “por que el orgullo? Un hombre nunca se sintió orgulloso de ser hombre por serlo”, “nunca más tambo, alianza lima, Sheraton”, “Rosquetes, maricones, enfermos mentales, pedofilos”. Estos y otros más solo demuestran que estamos demasiado atrasados como sociedad, que nos falta mucho por madurar, y hay mucha desinformación para ser más empaticos y tolerantes.

Pero, aunque puedan ser difíciles de leer u oír, esto nos hace querer con muchas más ganas y fuerza salir a demostrar que somos como todos, y valemos mucho por ello. Así también poder ayudar a demostrar a los que aún viven en las sombras que está bien ser diferente, que está bien aceptarse como uno es, que no hay sentimiento más gratificante que mirarte al espejo y estar feliz con el reflejo, y que sobretodo recordarte que NADIE tiene derecho a quitarte ese sentimiento. 
Vales mucho y tienes mucho por ofrecer. Hemos avanzado mucho, pero aún hay mucho camino por recorrer.

865,"Nina Cried Power is such an inspirational song, I highly recommend it, it's not only about standing up for what you believe in but the power of voice and how strong ones words can be. 
Hozier has inspired so many people with their powerful lyrics and lite up the world with his hit song: Take Me To Church.

The music video for Take Me To Church was surrounding a gay couple. The sad lyrics followed with the performance in the video showed the struggles of being openly gay and opened the eyes of our youth to how mistreated and unwelcomed the SAGA community is. 
Nina Cried Power and Take Me To Church are definitely my highest recommendation as songs to listen too along with many of Hozier's songs.

883,"Life can be as sour as milk in a sippy cup left in a car in July. (Gross) 
As a wife, mother, and small business owner, life can get overwhelming. I've been down over a week  post surgery, and my personal life...yuck...there's some not fun stuff there. (Think 9 day laundry pile)

Sometimes I cry when I'm alone. Sometimes I get really down. Sometimes (a lot of times) I'm too hard on myself. But it's okay. I'm learning to cry it out and then get a plan. 
My feelings are real and just that- feelings. I'm learning every day to look around and pat myself on the back for what I've done right! It's similar to an exercise in gratefulness. Instead of listing all the things I've done wrong, I list all the things I've done right. 
This helps so much with my mom guilt. Everything  gives me mom guilt. One thing I do right for my family is using safe cleaning products. I pat myself on the back because (even if I forgot to feed the kids breakfast) I know that the cleaning products I use are powerful for me yet safe for them. 
How do you move past your own self criticism? What do you do to relieve mom guilt?

I often ask my husband if he thinks I'm, or we, are good parents, and he always says ""if you have to the presence to ask that then you know that you are"" and I try to apply that to mom guilt as well... you're already balancing a lot on your plate, no need to add guilt on top of that.  everyone is doing the best they can and as long as the kids are happy and healthy, all is good 💕|♥️|I think it’s good to feel the feelings. They are valid and it helps me to just go with the emotions. And then reflect on all that you accomplish every single day! I hope things get better for you soon - Sending all kinds of positive vibes your way! ❤️|I think we can all relate! It helps to focus on being grateful for the things that are good. Being alive, kids are healthy and knowing that hards times won't last forever. Be encouraged 💞|I can definitely relate it’s so important to celebrate your wins big or small , and allow ourselves to feel vulnerable when times aren’t as pleasant I’m hoping July will bring a much needed positive shift 💕😘|I totally agree, mom guilt is real!  But I think most of it is self imposed.  We are all doing the best that we can.  I used to feel guilty for not being a Pintrest mom.  But my kids where taken care of, happy and healthy.  Trust me they didn't care of I was the ""perfect"" mom, they loved me anyway.  Geaux easy on yourself, you are doing a great job!  And don't let ANYONE tell you any different.|Wow!

893,"Today's Affirmation:
We are all Human!

To me personally this is a very loaded statement. It's not secret the America's history is deeply woven with discrimination. We have no reason to hate another group of people for existing. 
Black? Human.
Hispanic? Human.
White? Human.
Straight? Human.
Gay? Human.
Transgender? Human.
Man? Human.
Woman? Human.
Child? Human.
Christian? Human.
Muslim? Human.
Celebrities? Human.
Our idols? Human.
Our parents? Human.
Our teachers? Human.
We are all human. We all make mistakes. We are all just trying to make it through this life. And we all like to think that we know more than we do, or that others know more than they so. Embrace the imperfections of being human, and remember and everyone is trying to figure out it just like you. Be kind, be loving, and lift other up on their journey!
We are all human!
